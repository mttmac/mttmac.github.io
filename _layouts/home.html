          <h2 class="title">Brief Bio</h2>
          I solve problems using data science and technology: data analysis, machine learning, software systems, and
          sensors. I aim to build successful, simple, scalable, and safe solutions to meet diverse customer needs. I
          believe in deeply understanding customer requirements in order to discover integrated solutions that can
          stand the test of time. My current customers are physicians who want to use data to research smarter care for
          patients - more predictive, less reactive.

          <h2 class="title">Career Goal</h2>
          My goal is to develop AI/ML models and engineer systems that use them to solve real world problems, build
          useful tools, and improve lives in novel ways.
